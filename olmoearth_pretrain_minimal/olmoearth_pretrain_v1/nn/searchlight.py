"""Searchlight inference: every query attends within its own sliding neighborhood.

Tiled inference runs the encoder on training-size windows (16 px) and stitches them,
so a pixel's context jumps at every tile seam. Searchlight instead runs a whole domain
in one pass and gives every query the window it would see if a 16 px training window
were centred on it: ``W = neighborhood_attention_size_px / patch_size`` cells per side, sliding one cell at a
time and shifted inward (not shrunk) at the domain edge. The rule applies to all three
attentions of the ViT + Perceiver encoder (v1.3 RC, pix512):

* ViT self-attention: a token attends every token whose cell is in its box;
* Perceiver read: a latent attends every token in the box of the latent's cell;
* latent self-attention: a latent attends every latent whose cell is in that box.

Each is neighbourhood attention over a ``(rows, cols, K)`` grid with kernel
``(W, W, K)``, where ``K`` is the number of elements per cell; this needs the same
``K`` in every cell, i.e. missing data must be whole timesteps (which is how rslearn
exports it). On H100 NATTEN computes it exactly and fast; on A100 FlexAttention is
faster (see :func:`neighborhood_attention`). On CPU a dense masked reference is used
(tests and small checks only).

A domain one window wide reproduces the stock forward; larger domains are run as
overlapping crops by :func:`embed_domain`.

How to run it, setup and measured speed / quality: ``docs/Searchlight-Inference.md``
in allenai/olmoearth_pretrain.

Installing NATTEN (not a declared dependency; what worked on our H100 nodes):

* There is no source build in our images (no CUDA compiler), so use a prebuilt wheel
  from https://whl.natten.org. Each wheel is built for ONE torch + CUDA pair, and new
  wheels only target the two most recent torch releases.
* With the locked torch (2.9.1+cu128): ``natten==0.21.5+torch290cu128``.
* Newer torch: upgrade torch AND torchvision together (torch alone breaks the env),
  then pick the matching wheel, e.g. ``natten==0.21.6+torch2110cu128`` for torch
  2.11 (the fastest we measured) or ``natten==0.21.7+torch2130cu126`` for 2.13.
* The H100 nodes run NVIDIA driver 570, which cannot load CUDA 13 builds: use the
  cu12x torch and NATTEN wheels even when cu13x ones exist.
* The fast kernels are Hopper's. On A100 NATTEN runs (Ampere kernels) but slowly,
  so ``backend="auto"`` uses FlexAttention there and NATTEN is not needed.
